In mapsources/ directory are stored files fully describing map and map source, include uri, projection and get tile algorithm.

The filename are map name and .php ext.
Map name are directory name or .mbtiles file name in $tileCacheDir.
The map describe file include() to main programm, so check the php syntax!
None of the parameters in map describe file are required. If necessary, default parameters will be used.

The list of variables used in the description of the source is in mapsourcesVariablesList.php
You CANNOT modify this file.

Map describe file may content:

Main part - get the url of tile function:
function getURL($z,$x,$y,$getURLparams) {}
$z - zoom
$x - x number of tile
$y - y number of tile
$layer - section of path, such as http://base.url/$layer/$z/$y/$x.png for example.
Must return string of uri for get tile, or array of two items: string uri and array stream_context parameters.
About stream_context parameters see http://php.net/manual/en/context.php

For this function use utilites from fcommon.php

Other function - getTile() - is alternative way to get tile from local storage.
There is only one such function: getting a tile from a MBTiles format file. For MBTiles map the map description file can only consist of:
<?php
$functionGetTile = <<<'EOFU'
function getTile($r,$z,$x,$y){
	require_once('MBTilesClient.php');
	return serveMBTiles($r,$z,$x,$y);
} // end function getTile
EOFU;
?>
but for vector tiles you should specify
$ext = 'pbf';
$ContentType = 'application/x-protobuf';
$content_encoding = 'gzip';
and have a style file.

You can influence from map source file to GaladrielMap by
$data = array();
$data['javascriptOpen']; 	// the javascript string, eval'ed before create map
$data['javascriptClose']; 	// the javascript string, eval'ed after close map

Vector tiles --
must die. This is an ugly, resource-intensive format for benefit impudent merchants.
But a MapBox .pbf vector tiles has limited support. Style .json file must have the same name as the map source file and lie there.
ATTENTION! The stupid boys which developed MapBox format takes full url for resources. So glifs and icons lay in GaladrielMap directory, and every style file must have full path urls to it.
